        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Product Functions</h3>
        <p>
            DrO Website offers users the ability to create a personal account through a secure registration and login
            process. Once authenticated, users gain access to personalized features such as managing their own drink
            collections and saving preferences. The authentication system ensures that each user has a unique profile,
            which stores their custom lists and favorite drinks.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the core features of the application is the drink discovery feed. Users can browse a curated list of
            drinks, which can be filtered based on predefined categories such as "sodas", "waters", "lemonade","teas"
            and so on. Also, the drinks can be sorted by a nutrition score such as "A", "B", "C", "D" and/or "E".
            In addition to this, you can select a quantity interval for these drinks between 0 and 5000 ml.
            There is also a functionality to sort the drinks by different criterias, like "name","brand","nutrition
            grade","price". Each drink item includes a panel with detailed information such as name, brand, quantity,
            nutrition score
            and price, allowing users to make informed choices about what they want to save or try.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can interact with drinks by adding them to a list of favorites, making it easy to revisit them later.
            Additionally, the application allows the creation and management of custom drink lists. These lists can be
            named, edited, and populated with selected drinks based on personal taste or thematic groupings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drink lists can be modified at any time: users may rename them, delete them, or remove specific drinks from
            them. Depending on the implementation stage, lists can also be set as public or private, giving users
            control over how their collections are shared or displayed. The application maintains a clear and responsive
            interface to support these interactions seamlessly across devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application includes group-related features that allow users to join or create groups
            where information and personal imperssions about drinks can be shared among members.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to managing drinks and lists, users also have access to a profile section where they can update
            their personal information. They can change their profile picture, edit their display name, email address,
            and personal description, as well as update their account password. For full control over their data, the
            application also provides the option to permanently delete the account, which results in the removal of all
            associated content such as saved drinks and personal lists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users with administrative privileges have access to a dedicated admin panel where they can perform
            high-level management operations. Administrators can view and delete user accounts, remove entire groups
            created by users, or delete drinks from the global drink database when necessary. These actions help
            maintain the integrity of the platform and allow moderation of content that may violate usage guidelines or
            clutter the system with redundant data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application also features a ranking system that displays the most popular drinks based on how frequently
            they appear in users' favorite lists. This leaderboard offers a real-time overview of trending beverages
            within the community and encourages users to explore what others are enjoying. The ranking is automatically
            updated as users add or remove drinks from their favorites, providing a dynamic and relevant reflection of
            collective preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            DrO website also includes a statistics page where users can visualize aggregated data about the available
            drinks.
            These statistics are generated based on attributes such as quantity (e.g., volume in milliliters), nutrition
            grade, and assigned tags. This feature adds an analytical dimension to the application
            and enhances the exploratory experience.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
        <p>
            The primary user class of DrinkApp is composed of regular users who access the platform for personal use.
            These users can create an account, log in securely, and interact with the main features of the application
            such as browsing drinks, filtering by tags, saving favorites, and managing custom drink lists.
        </p>
        <p>
            A secondary user class is represented by administrators, who have access to an extended set of
            functionalities through a dedicated admin panel. These users are responsible for overseeing the integrity of
            the system by managing user accounts, moderating content, and removing inappropriate or redundant data such
            as duplicate drinks or inactive groups. Administrator access is restricted and requires elevated privileges
            assigned manually.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
        <p>
            DrinkApp is a web-based application that requires only a modern web browser and an active internet
            connection to function. It is designed to run on a wide range of client devices, including desktop
            computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
        </p>

        <p>
            The application is fully compatible with operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS,
            as long as a supported browser is available. Recommended browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla
            Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Opera. No installation is required, and the
            application runs entirely in the browser environment using client-side technologies.
        </p>

        <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
        <p>
            The development of DrinkApp was carried out under several deliberate design and implementation constraints.
            The most significant constraint was the requirement to avoid the use of any frontend frameworks or
            libraries. The entire application was developed using only native web technologies — HTML5, CSS3, and
            vanilla JavaScript — to encourage a deep understanding of core browser capabilities and to reduce external
            dependencies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, the frontend operates strictly on the client side and relies on RESTful API calls to
            communicate with the backend. This separation imposes certain design considerations, such as handling
            asynchronous requests manually and managing application state without the help of external tools. All
            frontend pages follow a "Pretty URLs" folder structure, which requires server-side support for routing if
            deployed on environments that do not natively handle static directory indexing.
        </p>

        <h3>2.6 User Documentations</h3>
        <p>
            DrinkApp provides two dedicated documentation pages designed to assist users in understanding and navigating
            the application: the <strong>About</strong> page and the <strong>Help</strong> page. These sections are
            accessible from the main navigation bar and offer relevant information for both first-time and returning
            users.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>About</strong> page offers a detailed overview of the application, its purpose, and its key
            functionalities. It includes a structured table of contents covering topics such as data management, user
            and group administration, statistics, rankings, RSS, favorites, and group interaction. The
            <strong>Help</strong> page focuses on user support and contact options. It includes instructions for
            reaching out in case of technical issues via a support email, as well as a visual presentation of the team
            members responsible for the project. A link to full technical documentation is also provided.
        </p>

        <h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
            This application assumes that users access the platform from a device with a stable internet connection and
            a modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It is also assumed that JavaScript is
            enabled in the browser, as core functionality relies on client-side logic.
        </p>

        <p>
            DrO website depends on the proper functioning of a backend service that exposes RESTful API endpoints. These
            endpoints are required for user authentication, data retrieval, drink list management, and statistics
            generation. If the backend service is unavailable or misconfigured, the application’s dynamic features may
            be partially or completely inaccessible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additional assumptions include server-side support for clean URLs (Pretty URLs) and proper CORS
            configuration to allow secure cross-origin requests between frontend and backend components.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="external-interface-requirements">
        <h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
        <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            The website uses a consistent layout across all pages, with a shared header that ensure a smooth
            and cohesive user experience. The header contains navigation links to the main sections of the platform —
            such as Home, Lists, Groups, and Statistics — and also includes icons for accessing the About and Help
            pages, along with the user profile area.
        </p>

        <p>
            The entire interface is built with clarity and accessibility in mind. A bold, modern font is used throughout
            the platform to enhance readability and maintain a professional yet friendly appearance. Colors are
            carefully chosen to align with the theme of soft drinks, using vibrant tones on a clean background to keep
            the user engaged.
        </p>

        <p>
            All pages are responsive and work seamlessly across devices. Main sections for authenticated users include
            persistent redirect buttons for easy navigation between modules, while secondary pages are accessible
            through direct navigation or through links embedded in the main interface. The layout is intuitive, and key
            actions such as adding to favorites, creating lists, or editing profile details are always clearly visible
            and accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            The application runs smoothly on a wide variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and
            smartphones. DrinkApp is fully responsive, ensuring that the interface adapts automatically to different
            screen sizes and device types.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the application is entirely web-based, an active internet connection is required for it to function
            properly. No installation or specific hardware configurations are needed beyond a standard input device
            (keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen) and access to a supported web browser.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3 Software Interface</h3>
        <p>
            The frontend of the application is built entirely with standard web technologies—namely
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript—without relying on any third-party frameworks or libraries.
            The layout is modular, each page having its own folder structure following the "Pretty URLs" convention, and
            the code is split into semantic files for structure, style, and behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
            Communication with the backend is achieved through a set of custom RESTful API endpoints
            that expose all major entities of the system (users, drinks, lists, favorites, groups, etc.).
            The frontend initiates HTTP requests using JavaScript’s <code>fetch()</code> API, and all requests and
            responses are exchanged in JSON format.
        </p>

        <p>
            All essential operations—such as user registration, login, password recovery, data retrieval, list creation,
            profile updates, and favorite management—are performed through
            HTTP methods: <code>GET</code> (data retrieval), <code>POST</code> (creation), <code>PATCH</code> (partial
            update), and <code>DELETE</code> (removal).
            Each operation is scoped to a specific endpoint, designed to follow a consistent, predictable route naming
            convention.
        </p>

        <p>
            The frontend securely handles authentication by storing a JWT (JSON Web Token) in memory
            and attaching it as a bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header of each request
            that targets a protected resource. This allows the backend to validate the identity and permissions of the
            user for each operation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Error handling is also implemented on the client side, where the frontend gracefully displays feedback for
            failed requests such as invalid input, expired tokens, or missing data.
            The application is designed to offer fallback behaviors and user-friendly error messages wherever
            applicable.
        </p>

        <h3>3.4 Communication Interface</h3>
        <p>
            The DrO platform provides multiple communication mechanisms to facilitate user interaction
            with the system and the development team.
            First, a dedicated Help page is available, offering users direct support instructions, a support
            email
            (<a href="mailto:support@drosite.example.com">support@drosite.example.com</a>), and a link to the complete
            technical documentation.
            This ensures users can easily report bugs, request assistance, or seek clarification.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, the system includes a mailing mechanism integrated with the authentication flow: during account
            creation and password recovery,
            users receive confirmation or reset instructions via email. All system-generated emails follow a standard
            format and are sent through the
            backend using secure SMTP configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
            While there is currently no direct contact form, communication is structured through predefined support
            channels, allowing users to access
            reliable help while maintaining platform security and simplicity.
        </p>

        <h3>3.5 API Interfaces</h3>
        <p>
            The application interacts with a custom REST API that handles all core functionalities related to user
            accounts, drinks, favorites, lists, groups, and rankings.
            The API follows standard HTTP methods such as <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, and
            <code>DELETE</code>, and communicates using JSON format.
        </p>

        <p>
            All authenticated requests require a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) passed via the <code>Authorization</code>
            header. For example, endpoints such as
            <code>/drinks/feed</code>, <code>/lists/:id</code>, or <code>/profile/update</code> are protected and
            personalized based on the user's identity.
        </p>

        <p>
            The API is modular and versioned, making it easy to extend in the future. A secure .env file is used on the
            frontend to store the base URL of the API,
            ensuring a separation between logic and configuration. This architecture enables the frontend to remain
            fully decoupled from the backend, simplifying
            development and deployment.

        <h2>4. Structure</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Entry Page</h3>
        <p>
        <p>
            The Entry Page serves as the landing point for all users, whether authenticated or not. It presents a clean
            and minimal layout with two primary options: navigating to the Login or Signup pages. This page is
            implemented using standard HTML and CSS, with no external frameworks. Its role is to route users toward
            authentication flows in a clear and user-friendly manner.
        </p>


        <h3>4.2 Log-In Page</h3>
        <p>
            The Login Page allows existing users to authenticate using their registered credentials. It features input
            fields for email and password, both validated on the client side for correct format and completeness. Upon
            submission, the data is sent via a POST request to the authentication API endpoint, and if successful, a JWT
            token is returned and stored for future access. Error messages are clearly displayed beneath the respective
            fields in case of invalid input or failed authentication attempts. The page also includes a link to the
            password recovery flow for users who have forgotten their credentials.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Register Page</h3>
        <p>
            The Register Page enables new users to create an account by filling out a form that includes a username,
            email, and password. Each field is validated both in real-time and upon submission. The username must be
            3–20 characters long and contain only letters, digits, or underscores, while the email is validated using a
            regular expression to ensure a proper format. The password must meet minimum security criteria. If all
            validations pass, the data is sent via a POST request to the backend, which creates the user account and
            returns a success response. Errors such as duplicate usernames or invalid data are shown inline, providing
            clear feedback to the user.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Home Page</h3>
        <p>
            The Home Page serves as the central hub for authenticated users, offering a personalized feed of drinks. The
            page retrieves drink data from the backend via asynchronous API calls and displays it in a grid-based
            layout, with each drink card showing key information such as the product name, nutrition grade, image, and
            available tags. Users can filter the feed using a sidebar with dynamic tag filters, which are also fetched
            from the backend. Sorting options such as “Order by name” or “Order by cathegory” are provided to improve
            navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the core features of the Home Page is the drink discovery feed. Users can browse a curated list of
            drinks, which can be filtered based on predefined categories such as "sodas", "waters", "lemonade", or
            "teas". Additionally, drinks can be sorted by nutrition grade ("A" to "E"), or filtered by quantity (between
            0 and 5000 ml). Sorting by other criteria such as "name", "brand", or "price" is also supported. Each drink
            panel includes detailed information that helps users decide whether to add the item to their favorites or
            explore it further. All these interactions are responsive and handled efficiently through JavaScript, using
            JWT authentication for secure access.
        </p>

        <h3>4.5 Lists Page</h3>
        <p>
            The Lists Page allows users to create and manage personalized collections of drinks. Each user can have
            multiple custom lists where they can add or remove drinks according to their preferences. Lists can be given
            a name and a visibility status (public or private), allowing users to share their recommendations or keep
            them private.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the interface, users can perform actions such as renaming a list, deleting it, or modifying its
            contents by removing or adding drinks. Each list displays a panel of the included drinks, showing basic
            information (name, image, nutrition grade) to facilitate quick browsing. The backend provides all
            list-related data through protected API endpoints, and all modifications are saved in real-time via
            authenticated HTTP requests.
        </p>

        <h3>4.6 Group Page</h3>
        <p>
            The Group Page provides a collaborative space where users can join thematic groups focused on specific
            interests, such as healthy drinks, energy beverages, or sustainable brands. Each group has a dedicated
            section where users can view shared drink recommendations, browse other members’ lists, and interact through
            posts or comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within a group, users can see the group's name, description, and drink collections associated
            with the community. Administrative users have access to special actions such as
            deleting inapropriate posts, removing members, or moderating content. All interactions are secured through
            authenticated API requests, and users must first join a group to gain access to its full features.
        </p>

        <h3>4.7 Join Group Page</h3>
        <p>
            The Join Group Page allows users to browse a list of public groups available on the platform. Each group
            entry displays key information such as the name or a short description. Users can search for groups using
            keywords or filter them by category to find
            communities that match their interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            To join a group, users simply click the “Join” button, which triggers a secure request to the server and
            grants access to the corresponding Group Page. If a group is private, the request is sent for approval by an
            administrator. Once joined, users can actively participate in the group’s discussions, view shared drinks,
            and contribute to the collective knowledge of the group.
        </p>

        <h3>4.8 Profile Page</h3>

        </p>

        <h2>5. System Features</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Account Management</h3>
        <p>
            We have implemented a system that allows the user to sign up and log in. The user can also log out to end
            their session at any time. Authentication is managed through sessions and cookies. Once logged in, users can
            view and edit their profile details, including their password. If a logged-in user tries to access the login
            or signup pages again, they are redirected to the home page. Similarly, if an unauthenticated user attempts
            to access restricted pages, they are redirected to the login page. The admin page is also protected, and any
            unauthorized access attempts result in redirection to the home page. Passwords are stored in encrypted form
            to ensure the security of user data. Accounts can be edited or deleted by administrators from the admin page
            if any rules are violated.
        </p>


        <h3>5.2 Multi-Criteria Search System</h3>

        <p>The application provides users with multiple options to search and filter drinks based on various criteria.
            Users can filter drinks by predefined categories such as "sodas", "waters", "lemonades", and "teas".

            In addition, drinks can be sorted by nutrition grade (A, B, C, D, or E), by brand, name, price, or quantity.
            Users can also define a custom quantity range (from 0 to 5000 ml) to narrow down the results.

            All these filtering and sorting options are applied instantly to the drink feed, offering a flexible and
            user-friendly way to discover new beverages tailored to their preferences.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Statistics Export System</h3>
        <p>The statistics page provides an interactive and informative way for users to explore various data related to
            their selected drinks. They can analyze the distribution of drinks by quantity, nutrition grade, or tags
            through intuitive pie and bar charts, all built without external frameworks. These visualizations help users
            gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the drinks added in the application.</p>

        <p>The user has the option to download the data as CSV or JSON files, directly from the graphical interface.
            This enables further processing of the data or integration into other external systems. For each type of
            displayed statistic, there is a dedicated download button, making it easy to save individual sets of
            relevant information.</p>

        <p>Additionally, for the ranking page, which displays the most popular drinks based on how many users added them
            to their favorites, we have implemented an RSS feed. This feed provides an automated way to track updates in
            the top rankings, allowing applications or users to be notified whenever changes occur. Thus, our statistics
            and export system offers both accessibility and automation.</p>

        <h3>5.4 Leaderboards</h3>
        <p> In our application, we have implemented a dynamic leaderboard system that highlights the most appreciated
            drinks among users, based on how often they have been added to personal favorite lists. This system relies
            on a many-to-many relationship between users and drinks, allowing us to calculate and rank the most
            favorited items in real time. The leaderboard displays the top 10 drinks with the highest number of unique
            users who added them to their favorites, offering a clear view of the community’s preferences. </p>

        <p> The purpose of this page is to help users discover popular drinks curated through collective taste, rather
            than editorial suggestion. The drinks are ordered descending by favorite count and updated automatically as
            user preferences evolve. This encourages interaction and exploration, offering users a way to find trending
            items and see which drinks are consistently appreciated across the platform. </p>

        <h3>5.5 User Friendly-Interface</h3>
        <p> Our platform was designed with a strong focus on user experience, providing an intuitive and accessible
            interface that ensures ease of navigation and usability for users of all ages and technical backgrounds. The
            layout is clean and logically structured, allowing users to quickly understand how to interact with
            different features, from browsing and filtering drinks to managing their personal lists and preferences.
            Interactive elements such as tooltips, hover effects, and clear feedback messages contribute to a seamless
            interaction with the platform. </p>
        <p> Additionally, the website is fully responsive and adapts gracefully to various screen sizes and devices,
            including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This guarantees a consistent and enjoyable experience across
            all platforms. All design decisions were made with accessibility and clarity in mind, resulting in an
            application that feels modern, lightweight, and pleasant to use, even during extended browsing sessions.
        </p>

        <h3>5.6 Administration Page</h3>
        <p> The administrator page integrates all functionalities available to a regular user, such as viewing and
            editing their own profile information – including username, email, description, and password – as well as
            the ability to delete their account or log out from the application. Beyond these common features, the
            administrator is granted elevated privileges that allow for full moderation and oversight of platform
            content. </p>
        <p> Through this panel, administrators can view and permanently delete any user-generated content, including
            drinks and groups created on the platform. They also have the authority to manage user accounts by removing
            those who violate platform rules or engage in inappropriate behavior. These administrative capabilities are
            essential for maintaining the quality and integrity of the application and ensure a safe, respectful, and
            organized environment for all users. The interface for the admin section preserves the same intuitive and
            responsive design, making moderation tasks efficient and accessible. </p>

        <h3>5.7 REST API</h3>
        <p> Our application is built upon REST API principles to ensure modularity, scalability, and a clear separation
            of responsibilities between the frontend and backend. We implemented well-structured endpoints that follow a
            consistent and logical URL schema, allowing both regular users and administrators to interact with the
            system in a predictable and efficient manner. </p>
        <p> For regular users, endpoints are available to handle authentication, account management, drink and list
            creation, viewing, editing, and deletion. Administrators have access to extended routes that provide
            functionality for managing global resources, such as deleting drinks, user accounts, and entire groups
            directly from the database. The API supports all standard HTTP methods—GET for fetching resources, POST for
            creating, PUT/PATCH for updating, and DELETE for removing entities. </p>

        <h3>5.8 MVC Arhitecture</h3>
        <p>
            The backend is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which ensures a clear
            separation of concerns between the data layer (models), the application logic (controllers), and the
            external interface (views, i.e., API responses). To further organize the codebase, we introduced service
            layers that handle business logic separately, making the system easier to maintain, extend, and test.
        </p>

        <p>
            This structured design improves both scalability and clarity, allowing developers to isolate and modify
            specific functionalities without interfering with others. Combined with our RESTful API, the MVC
            architecture ensures better reliability, easier debugging, and readiness for future integrations, such as
            mobile clients or external services.
        </p>

        <h3>5.9 HTML and CSS validation</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure a high standard of quality and accessibility, we carefully validated all the HTML and CSS code
            using the official W3C validation tools. This process helped us identify and correct structural or syntactic
            issues, making the website more reliable and compliant with web standards.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, we verified that the layout remains fully responsive across a wide range of screen sizes and
            devices, offering a consistent and pleasant user experience. We also focused on maintaining the security of
            the website and the protection of user data through good development practices, contributing to both
            usability and trust.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="other-nonfunctional-requirements">
        <h2>6. Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Performance Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The application is optimized to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, with minimal loading times
            across all supported devices. Static assets are efficiently served, and JavaScript execution is streamlined
            to reduce delays during navigation and interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            API requests are expected to return responses within 300ms in typical scenarios, with pagination and
            filtering mechanisms in place to prevent excessive data load. Backend endpoints return only the necessary
            data, which helps improve both speed and scalability as the number of users or items grows.
        </p>

        <h3>6.2 Security Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The system implements multiple safety measures to ensure the protection of user data and prevent any form of
            unauthorized access or data leakage.
            Passwords are stored in encrypted form using secure hashing algorithms, and no sensitive user information is
            exposed in plain text, either on the client or server side.
            All form inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks or accidental data corruption.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to prevent unauthorized data access, the backend enforces strict access control. Each user only has
            permission to view or modify their own data.
            Administrative functions such as user deletion, group removal, or drink moderation are restricted
            exclusively to users with elevated privileges.
            These admin operations are separated from the regular user interface and require authentication with a valid
            JWT token tied to an admin account.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the registration process, security-focused validation rules are applied to prevent abuse and ensure
            clean data.
            Usernames must contain between 3 and 20 characters and may only include letters, digits, and underscores.
            Email addresses are validated using regular expressions to ensure they follow the correct format.
            These constraints help prevent account spamming and contribute to maintaining the integrity of the user
            database.
        </p>

        <h3>6.3 Safety Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            Although the application does not deal with physical safety concerns, several measures are taken to ensure
            safe digital interactions.
            The platform limits the potential for misuse or instability by validating user input, enforcing strict data
            formats, and maintaining predictable system behavior.
            All critical operations are gated by appropriate checks to avoid unintentional data manipulation or system
            disruption.
        </p>
        <p>
            User input is thoroughly validated both on the client and server side to prevent malformed data and
            accidental misuse.
            Error handling is implemented gracefully, so even in unexpected scenarios, the system provides informative
            feedback without compromising stability.
            Additionally, the frontend does not expose raw error traces or server-side messages, reducing the risk of
            information leakage.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prevent database leaks or integrity issues, the system avoids exposing direct database identifiers and
            filters all user-submitted input.
            Although the platform does not involve physical safety, digital safety is a priority.
            Regular backend-side validations, limited input lengths, and careful handling of exceptions reduce the risk
            of service abuse or accidental system crashes.
        </p>

        <h3>6.4 Software Quality Attributes</h3>
        <p>
            The application prioritizes usability and responsiveness across all supported platforms. Its intuitive
            layout, clear labeling, and consistent design patterns ensure that users can easily navigate and interact
            with the system, regardless of technical background. All features are structured to provide quick feedback
            and minimal friction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maintainability is a key focus of the implementation. The frontend is developed using modular HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript code without any external frameworks, which facilitates debugging and future extensions. The
            backend is structured into well-defined endpoints that follow RESTful conventions, making it easier to
            understand, test, and refactor components independently.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system is also built with reliability and fault tolerance in mind. Failures in API communication, user
            input errors, or edge cases are handled gracefully, with clear user messages and fallback mechanisms where
            needed. As a result, the application remains stable and predictable even under atypical usage conditions.
            Additionally, all database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
        </p>

        <h3>6.5 Business Rules</h3>
        <p>
            The application enforces a set of business rules to ensure data consistency, user experience integrity, and
            alignment with platform goals. Each user must create an account to access personalized functionalities such
            as creating drink lists, adding favorites, or posting new drinks. Usernames must be unique and conform to
            specific validation rules, while emails are checked for correctness using regular expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrative actions, such as managing user accounts or moderating drinks and groups, are restricted to
            users with elevated privileges. These operations are separated from the general interface and require
            JWT-based authentication tied to an admin account. Additionally, duplicate list names are not allowed per
            user, and a drink cannot be added multiple times to the same list.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tags and nutrition grades associated with drinks follow a standardized structure to facilitate filtering and
            statistics generation. Any action that modifies persistent data, such as deleting a user or removing a
            drink, is subject to validation to prevent data inconsistency or accidental loss.

        <p>
            This project was developed with the aim of creating a functional and educational web platform where users
            can discover, organize, and explore various drinks. We believe that building such an application helped us
            better understand both technical and user-centered aspects of web development, while also delivering a
            useful tool for everyday use.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are open to future improvements and feedback from users, as we strongly believe that a collaborative
            approach leads to better products. Whether it's filtering drinks by nutrition score, creating personalized
            lists, or exploring aggregated statistics, we hope the platform will provide a meaningful and intuitive
            experience. We truly enjoyed working on this project and hope it will be just as enjoyable to use.
        </p>
